## mass-rename

`mass-rename` was a script to automate the process of rename files specifically large quantities of photos. Scenarios such as renaming a collective of photos from a trip, event, or person would be beneficial with a prefix and file count. The renaming priority is sorted by the file's modified timestamp in ascending order. 

```
In the same directory as the main.py file, create a staging directory.
$ mkdir staging

After staging files in the directory, run the python script after changing the directory file paths and wanted file prefix.
$ python main.py
```
